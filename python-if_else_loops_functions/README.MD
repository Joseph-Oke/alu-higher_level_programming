This Python README.MD file assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is run, and then prints whether the number is positive, zero, or negative. The script uses the `random` module to generate a new number on each execution, demonstrating basic conditional logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements. It also documents different scripts which has been run.
